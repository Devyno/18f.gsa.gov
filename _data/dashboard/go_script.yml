full_name: The `./go` script

description: A ./go script aims to abstract away all of the steps needed to develop (and sometimes deploy) a software project. It is a replacement for READMEs and other documents that may become out-of-date, and when maintained properly, should provide a cohesive and discoverable interface for common project tasks. This gem abstracts common functionality used in the Ruby-based ./go scripts of several 18F projects, and provides a ./go script generator for new projects.

impact: Abstracts away all of the steps needed to develop (and sometimes deploy) a software project, saving developers time.


tagline: Provides a cohesive and discoverable interface for common project tasks.
