description: The General Services Administration and several other agencies wanted a way to give the public a predictable, reliable way to sign in and manage their accounts on government websites. MyUSA — a digital platform that allows Americans to register, sign in, and manage ongoing transactions with the U.S. federal government —  makes government resources easier to access, and government tasks and processes easier to keep track of.

impact: A single, trusted, predictable experience for signing into government services, making it easier to access government websites and keep track of tasks and processes.

tagline: We're making it easier for people to sign into and manage accounts on federal government websites.
