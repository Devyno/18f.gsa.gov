description: The Federalist platform is a suite of tools designed to make it faster and cheaper for government agencies to build websites that are secure, responsive, and accessible. We developed Federalist for two audiences: federal developers who need a platform for reliable, quick hosting of static sites, and federal groups that may not have a developer on staff but need secure, accessible, and responsive websites to get their content out to the public.

impact: Lets agencies quickly launch secure, accessible, and responsive websites that can easily handle large spikes in traffic.

tagline: We're making it easy for agencies to quickly launch secure, accessible, and responsive websites.
