description: Full production datasets are too unwieldy to duplicate to the test and development environments. Projects are typically tested against small hand-written test databases instead, but those simple constructs can't duplicate the quirks and complexities of the production data set â€” and the most subtle application bugs will only be revealed when applied to those quirks. rdbms-subsetter solves that issue by generating a random sample of rows from a relational database that preserve referential integrity. So long as constraints are defined, all parent rows will exist for child rows.

impact: Improves development and testing quality by creating high fidelity simulations of the production environment.


tagline: We designed an easy way to create test or development databases from production.
