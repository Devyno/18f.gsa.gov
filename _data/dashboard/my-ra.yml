description: 18F worked with the Treasury Department on an early iteration of employer and individual landing pages design for Treasuryâ€™s My Retirement Account program. The project was handed off to the partner agency in June 2015.

impact: Millions of Americans do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, which includes more than 50% of full-time and 75% of part-time workers. The myRA site provides clear information about a retirement program available to everybody.

tagline: We helped the Treasury Department design an early iteration of a landing page for a retirement program.
